1. Objective:
This project visualizes housing data from the King County dataset (kc_house_data.csv) on an interactive map using Python. The main objectives are to:
  - Visualize the geographic distribution of homes using latitude and longitude
  - Represent house prices using marker color and size
  - Enhance usability with interactive tooltips that display key house details

2. Output:
An interactive web-based map that visually represents house prices across King County. Each house is shown as a colored, semi-transparent circle: Larger circles represent more expensive homes. Brighter colors correspond to higher price quantiles. Tooltips display key home information when the user hovers over a marker.
